## Architecture

The Auro Wallet extension is built with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Below is a high-level overview of the system:

<!-- ![Architecture Diagram](docs/auro-extension-wallet.png) -->

- **Auro-UI**: The front-end interface built with React, Redux, and Thunk, featuring components like `app`, `account-info`, `accounts-manage`, `send-page`, `stake-page`, `setting-page`, and `locked-page`. It interacts with actions and reducers for state management.
- **Auro-Background**: Manages background processes, including the `id store` and `config manager` (handling service-data config, encrypted keys, and account lists).
- **Service-Data**: Interfaces with external services like `mina-graphql` (for balance, transactions, staking, and block info) and `mina-indexer` (for validator details, fee recommendations, and transaction results).
